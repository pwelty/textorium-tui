## What shipped today

- PRODUCT.md filled in with problem statement, users, vision, 6 principles, and success metrics
- ROADMAP.md milestone dates converted to ISO format for `pm_roadmap` GitHub sync compatibility
- `paulos.project.toml` initialized (GitHub-backed task tracking)
- 5 GitHub milestones created via `pm_roadmap --apply`
- Landing page TUI section written (committed in Textorium monorepo, deploy pending verification)
- Cleaned up 5 generic `pm_generate` issues and replaced with 1 specific landing page issue (GH-7)

## Completed

- `57c5e2f` Docs: Add product vision, fix roadmap date format, init paulos config
- Roadmap review — confirmed Q1 milestones and dates still hold
- GitHub milestone sync (5 created: TUI on Homebrew, Visual overhaul, Bulletproof editing, CLI essentials, First external user)
- Landing page code for textorium.app TUI section (brew install command, GitHub link, updated meta)

## Carry-over

- Verify Cloudflare Pages deployment of landing page (textorium.app still showing "Coming soon")
- Close GH-7 once deploy confirmed
- Close "TUI on Homebrew" milestone once landing page is live

## Risks

- Cloudflare Pages may not be auto-deploying from the `website/` subdirectory — needs investigation from the Textorium monorepo context

## Next session

- Verify textorium.app deploy and close Homebrew milestone
- Start visual overhaul milestone (better TUI layout, colors, status indicators)
- Dogfood textorium on polymathic-h to surface rough edges
